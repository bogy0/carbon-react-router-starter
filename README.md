# carbon-starter

This project is intended as a guiding template to get you and your team started with a fresh project basing on the Carbon Design System.

It is intended to be helping, not dictating. If you don't know exactly what to use, feel free to take this as a starting point. You can of course swap anything in this stack with your preferred tool if you want to.

## Get started

1. Clone this template
1. Install the dependencies. *Requires Node 22*
    ```
    npm i
    ```
1. Run the template
    ```
    npm run dev
    ````

â†’ Good, you're already set up!

Create a production build with `npm run build`, but be aware that a server runtime is needed as this project uses server-side rendering.

## How do this work

### Philosophy

This project is driven by a few principles:
- Fast to instantiate, easy to understand
- Usable by a large set of projects
- Opinionated but not dictating
- Performance and accessibility oriented

Ultimately, we want to save you time by avoiding you weeks of research to build a simple base stack to create a first iteration from.

### Project structure

- **Carbon inclusion:** right now this project embeds the latest version of Carbon core, but not yet Carbon for IBM Products or Carbon for IBM Cloud. Contributions in this direction would be welcome.

- **CSS and SCSS:** basing on Carbon, this project makes extensive use of SCSS. To improve the loading experience and avoid layout shifts and flash of unstyled content, we decided to load the SCSS from the `index.html` file. If you have a case where you a lot of CSS on very dynamic conditions, you might decide to use an `import` statement inside on of your React components. However, be aware that this should stay exceptions as the styles will be delayed after the component has been loaded.

- **Server-side rendering:** server-side rendering is a critical component for most applications to improve their performance. This means here that **the project is separated in two parts - client-side and server-side**.

- **Quality and productivity helpers:** this project contains quite a few helpers to help consistency, productivity and speed. For example it has templates for unit and end-to-end testing. It also contains linters so your team doesn't have to lose time on code formatting.
With time we plan to add more helpers to help you monitor your accessibility and front-end performance.
